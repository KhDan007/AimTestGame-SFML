# AimTestGame-SFML
simple aim test game using sfml c++ framework

to open this game u should download SFML. I've used SFML 2.5.1, so download it on the official site (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and add the "External"
near .sln file of my project. In this folder you should pase folder "inlcude", and "lib". After it, u can run the game.
Good luck!
